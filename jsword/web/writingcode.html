<h2>Aims</h2>
<ul>
  <li>JSword should be a Bible study library with which to build various front-ends.
    Front-ends could include Applets, stand-alone Swing/AWT/SWT GUIs, server-side
    processing for JSP/Servlets, and more advanced projects like link mappers
    and translations.</li>
  <li>It should help Bible study through various optional front-ends that are
    shipped with JSword or separately.</li>
  <li>It should be easliy contributed-to, and easily used.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coding Recommendations</h2>
<h4>JDK Versions</h4>
<p>This is all currently being written using JDK 1.3. The basis for this is that
  (where practical) we will retain support for JDKs where some of our users have
  no better options. So at the time of writing MacOS only supports JDK1.3, we
  have people wanting to use JSword on MacOS, so when we want to use JDK1.4 only
  features (for example roll-over toolbar buttons) we'll use reflection or some
  other trick to remain compatible with JDK1.3.</p>
<h4>Coding Standards</h4>
<p>The coding standards used on this project so far are very much based on the
  SUN coding standards. This is some notes on style we are using, some of this
  deviates from the SUN standard, and some is just extensions to it.</p>
<h5>Packaging</h5>
<p>There is a split between classes that are specific to this project and those
  that could be usefully employed elsewhere. Generally we should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a much code general as possible</li>
  <li>Only generalize where there is a point - specifically and code that does
    something Bible specific should not be general</li>
  <li>Never import specific code in generalized code</li>
</ul>
<p> Generalized code exists in <code>org.crosswire</code>. Code specific to this
  project lives in <code>org.crosswire.jsword</code>.</p>
<p>Also, since there is an MVC relationship between various parts of the code
  we avoid importing <code>org.crosswire.jsword.view.*</code> in any other code,
  and avoid importing <code>org.crosswire.jsword.control.*</code> in anything
  but <code>org.crosswire.jsword.view.*</code></p>
<p>Also any code specific to an interface X should be in a package containing
  x. For example all swing specific code is in a *swing* package. This helps
  us in packaging code for a distribution, in excluding other interfaces.</p>
<h5>Bracket Indentation</h5>
<p>The "Sun Way" conserves screen space at the expense of readibility - which
  given the cost of decent size monitors these days seems silly. A lot of Java
  code, seems to ignore Sun and do it this way:</p>
<pre>if (something)
{
    func();
}</pre>
<h5>Variable Naming</h5>
<p>Sun recommend using the same convention as for method names. This does confuse
  method names and variable names. So the suggested use for this project is all
  lower case names with optional underscores between words. For example <code>word_count</code> or <code>wordcount</code> and
  not <code>wordCount</code>. The Sun method makes some sense if you intend to
  use public member variables, however that is generally not recommended behavior.</p>
<h5>Class Ordering</h5>
<p>Variables are not important members of a class so why put them at the top?
  JSword usage puts them at the bottom.</p>
<h5>Tabbing</h5>
<p>4 space indents are a Good Thing, however using a tab character instead of
  4 spaces just causes problems when you want to print, open in a different editor,
  or want to paste into an html doc using &lt;pre&gt; tags. Everything will look
  exactly the same if you use spaces instead of tabs.</p>
<h5>Preamble</h5>
<p>All java source should have the following at the end of the class JavaDoc</p>
<pre>
 * &lt;p>&lt;table border='1' cellPadding='3' cellSpacing='0'>
 * &lt;tr>&lt;td bgColor='white' class='TableRowColor'>&lt;font size='-7'>

<p>The result looks something like this from JavaDoc:</p>

<h4>Similarity beween Java Sword API and C++ Sword API</h4>
<p> The core Java API is similar in that there are concepts like Key, Verse etc
  in both. However there are differences; In Java Verse is stateless but the
  C++ SWVerse is stateful. For those wanting to write Java code using the C++
  API there is an API compatibility tree (under development) that calls the core
  tree. This compatibility tree tries to mimic the C++ wherever possible. </p>
<p> The 2 APIs are not more similar to 2 reasons, one historic JSword was originally
  written under the name ProjectB, and only later merged into JSword. However
  there are a number of problems with language independant APIs. They all risk
  falling into the same traps as CORBA, DOM and SAX - all good examples of how
  *not* to write an API, and hence the need for RMI/EJB, JDOM/XOM/DOM4J/JAXB/etc.<br/>
  An example for our case would be statefulness. Should the low level APIs for
  Verse etc be stateful? In C++/Sword they are, and there is sense for this in
  C++ because operator overloading makes incrementing a verse easy. Java however
  has a powerful concept of immutability that does not seem to be as important
  in C++, so a Java string is guaranteed not to change, where C++ lets you cast
  away any protection. Immutability lets us return values without cloning them,
  and be sure that they will not change, and it lets them have an ordering in
  a list that otherwise would be meaningless. </p>
