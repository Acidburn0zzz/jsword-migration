    <h1>Obtain and Install Java for Linux</h1>
<p>
  Sun's Java is proprietary and not open source. But it is what we use for BibleDesktop and JSword.
  At this time there is no open source Java that will run our application.
  For that reason, you will need to get Sun's Java from them and install it. However, Sun's Java RPM
  does not install correctly. To install it correctly you will need to use JPackage's Java Package.
</p>
<p>
  The following steps will allow you to install Sun's Java correctly. Below is how to install Java 1.5
  but the same can be done for Java 1.4.2. At this time, if you need to install Java 1.4.2, you may need
  to install 1.5 first.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>With these steps you will be building a RPM. So, if you have not already done so, install rpm-build.
      <p class="instruction root">su -c "yum install rpm-build"</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you have not done so create a build tree like the following in your home directory:
    <pre xml:space="preserve">        rpm
        |-- BUILD
        |-- RPMS
        |   |-- i386
        |   |-- i586
        |   `-- noarch
        |-- SOURCES
        |-- SPECS
        |-- SRPMS
        `-- tmp
    </pre>
    You can do this with the following commands:
    <p class="instruction">
        mkdir ~/rpm               <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/BUILD         <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/RPMS          <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/RPMS/i386     <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/RPMS/i586     <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/RPMS/noarch   <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/SOURCES       <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/SPECS         <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/SRPMS         <br/>
        mkdir ~/rpm/tmp
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Create a good .rpmmacros file:
    <p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">%_topdir        %(echo ${HOME}/rpm)
%_tmppath       %{_topdir}/tmp

# Change the following to work for you
%packager       Firstname Lastname &lt;your.address@here&gt;

# Uncomment to have built RPMs land in <code>RPMS/</code> instead of <code>RPMS/&lt;arch&gt;/
#%_rpmfilename  %%{NAME}-%%{VERSION}-%%{RELEASE}.%%{ARCH}.rpm
</code></pre>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Obtain JPackage's <a href="http://www.jpackage.org/rpm.php?id=3033">Java 1.5.0 Source</a> RPM.<br/>
      Click on the link that looks something like <quote>java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.05-1jpp.nosrc.rpm.</quote><br/>
      and save the file to your home directory.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>Obtain the corresponding Java package from Sun. For example, if you downloaded from JPackage
      <p class="instruction"><quote>java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.05-1jpp.nosrc.rpm.</quote></p>
      then you will want to download from Sun.
      <p class="instruction"><quote>jdk-1_5_0_05-linux-i586.bin</quote></p>
      <p>If this is the most recent version of Sun's Java then you can get it from:</p>
      <p class="instruction"><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp</a></p>
      <p>otherwise, you will need to get it from Sun's Java Product Archive:</p>
      <p class="instruction"><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/archive">http://java.sun.com/products/archive</a></p>
      <p>Save this file to your ~/rpm/SOURCES.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Rebuild the JPackage Java 1.5.0 Source RPM.
      <p class="instruction">rpmbuild --rebuild java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.05-1jpp.nosrc.rpm</p>
      <p>There will be lots of output!</p>
  </li>
  <li>Install the newly created unsigned RPMs. (This will require temporarily changing /etc/yum.conf so that gpgcheck=0. Remember to set it back when you are done!) These will be below ~/rpm/RPMS. If ~/rpm/RPMS/i586 then the command would be:
      <p class="instruction root">cd ~/rpm/RPMS/i586<br/>su -c "yum localinstall java*.rpm"</p>
  </li>
  <li>Make javaws available with: (Do this if /usr/bin/javaws does not exist)
      <p class="instruction">su -c "ln -s /etc/alternatives/javaws /usr/bin/javaws"</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
