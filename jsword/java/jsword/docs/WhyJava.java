Why have I chosen to write this project in Java?. 

<p><strong>Why Java?</strong>: In chosing a language for any project there will
always be some trade-offs. Java has big plus points in three areas:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Trendyness</strong>: 
    Being trendy means that there are XML libraries, Script libraries, etc for 
    it far earlier than anything else, and the implementations of these are 
    better than anywhere else. C and C++ compete, languages like VB and Delphi 
    are not even close.
  <li><strong>Portability</strong>: 
    Java is close to being automatically portable between systems, and the 
    effort to get 100% portability is low. C and C++ require a lot of effort to 
    make portable. VB and Delphi are not even close.
  <li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: 
    Java is a very easy to use language - it encourages good programming style. 
    Delphi is as good, VB and C++ can be as good, but it is not automatic - you 
    can make a real mess in either very easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bad news is that Java falls down in a number of 
areas:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance</strong>: 
    C and C++ are faster than Delphi and VB, and Java is probably a close last. 
    I don't see this as a huge problem. Computers are for ever getting faster. 
    When was the last time your Pentium II, was seriously CPU locked? Pentium II 
    sound too up to date? By the end of the year when I hope this project will 
    be doing useful stuff you will probably not be able to by them any more they 
    will be so out of date. Yes, people have old 486s. There are other Bible 
    programs in appealing to yesterdays technology.
  <li><strong>GUI Creation</strong>: 
    Both VB and Delphi do drag and drop GUI building better. That is not to say 
    Java GUIs are less functional - on the contrary, show me a multiple look and 
    feel GUI in VB or Delphi, just that it is harder work getting there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prof. Moore told us a long time ago that the computing world advances quite
quickly, and it is surprising how quickly some people forget it.</p>
