<h1>Source Code Access</h1>
<h2>This is currently under construction. Some info is inaccurate.</h2>
<p>
  Our source code is managed with Subversion, aka SVN. SVN is hosted at crosswire. The SVN root is:<br />
  <code>https://crosswire.org/svn/jsword</code><br />
  Anyone can access the code without a password and can be browsed at this url.<br/>
  The project to checkout is <code>jsword</code>, so if you are using the command line you would
  do something like this<br />
  <code>svn checkout https://crosswire.org/svn/jsword/trunk/jsword jsword</code>.<br />
  You will need to repeat this for each of bibledesktop, common and common-swing.
  There is also <code>jsword-support</code>, containing 3rd-party QA tools<br/>
  <code>jsword-web</code> contains the code for the JSword website and
  bibledesktop-web houses the website for BibleDesktop.
