This file is our equivalent of bugzilla for the time being, it is also our
roadmap for the next few releases:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swing
- Interrupting/cancelling a download does not cleanup the download.
  This is perhaps a bigger problem of the semantic of job cancellation merely
  interrupting a thread.
- Maybe hide the reference pane if there are no reference works
- Help (By linking to web?)
- Split panes resize when they should not.
  (Probably due to packing issues when flipping components)
- Menu shortcuts are duplicated on several menus and don't work as expected.

BookData Display
- Naves shows internal markup around verse references.
- some nt verses badly displayed in ot refs
- Notify the user when a single testament bible is installed.
- Need a better font under FC2.

SplitBookDataDisplay
- Selection not maintained when blur button is clicked.
- Consider a context menu to open a verse in a new tab.
- Reuse tabs when possible. When opening a daily reading,
  check to see if it is already a BibleView.

Reference Sidebar:
- Selecting a commentary should (possibly) display the comments for the currently displayed passage
- I don't see any entries after selecting "Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary"
    - I think it's waiting for me to type something in, but that's not obvious from the UI
    - When I tried to type something into the text field, it didn't work
    - Maybe the sidebar text area should clear or display a message like "Type a word in the text field above to see its definition."
- Selecting a commentary does not display the contents of that commentary for the passage shown (e.g. Gen 1:1)

Web
- auto test for web demo

Install
- save install sites
- warning about web access in install
- Cannot see any bibles until hitting "Update Index" for the first time
- Need a progress bar (even with .setIndeterminate(true)) instead of two dialogs
- Cannot see all of the text on the "Values" column of the table
- "Keys" and "Values" are not very friendly column titles
  Key names are internal names, not user-friendly names
- Perhaps replace the keys/values table with an HTML description of the module
- make indexing progress bar display better
- Allow only one indexing at a time

About box:
- Appears to be in a tab for no particular reason
- Just shows the version, seems kinda pointless
    - Maybe add a list of developers or something

Search
- Implement match in lucene using wild cards
- retire ser, replacing it w/ lucene
- make index creation happen at a better time

Options:
- Even after installation, there are no bibles/dictionaries/commentaries to select from for the defaults ("Bibles" item)
- Internationalize the text of some of the options and make them friendly.
  Many of the options are rather user-unfriendly and need help text, e.g.:
    - What's "Persistent Naming"?
- Make sure tree has horizontal and vertical lines on all platforms.
	Under FC2: tree has only horizontal lines, no vertical lines

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE v0.9.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- emergency bug fixes only

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swing
- recreate module creator/tester
- merge dict/comment to form reference pane
- implement print
- FOP/PDF export
- FontChooser should show a sample of text in Greek, Hebrew and user's language.
  Font name should be in the default font, not in the font's font.
- Highlighting of searches
- In View Source, it would be nice to have the source syntax-highlighted and maybe tidied
- Add toolbar customization

Search
- Create the index in the background after the module is downloaded.
- Change the indexing of accented data to strip them from the index.
- Normalize the search request to the way the index is built. (Bug fix)
- Use IBM's ICU4J to do this.
- Add the ability to search transliterations of Greek and Hebrew.
- Add the ability to search by word stems.
  Find occurrences of various forms of Greek/Hebrew words
  e.g. blepo, blepeis, eidon, blepamenos, etc. could all match a search for blepein

Modules
- Sword GenBook
- re-Add the delete module button
- add a direct OSIS module
- Add support for Deutrocanonical books (the "third" testament")
- Add support for Bible Intro. (i.e. testament 0)

General
- Make config use Preferences
- Use preferences: When starting the program it would be nice to have the same state as when the program was closed.
- other application installation systems (rpm, deb, nullsoft, msi, etc)
- Add a personal commentary ability.

BookData Display
- Mixed language text support (like Kittel's or Vines).
- Interlinear for text having strongs numbers.
- Parallel texts (Bible || Bible, Bible || Commentary, Bible || Dictionary)
- Add the ability to turn accents/diacriticals on/off.
- Allow for more than one link per word
  (may not be able to use link or maybe link does a dialog w/ results)
  more than one strongs number [see gen 1.1 created in KJV]
  other lemma values
  morph values
- Switch to the right dictionary/commentary/... when link is activated
- Handle pictures (e.g. in the Illustrated New Testament ;)
- For Greek or Hebrew texts, show hover-help for each word with basic definition (from default Greek/Hebrew dictionary)
- For Greek or Hebrew texts, have a RMB menu to open a dictionary for the selected text or something

Install
- Add a language filter
- Add information on how big a download will be
