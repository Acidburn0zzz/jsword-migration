  <title>JSword - Aims</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Aims</h2>

<ul>
  <li>JSword should be a Bible study library with which to build various 
	front-ends. Front-ends could include Applets, stand-alone Swing/AWT/SWT 
	GUIs, server-side processing for JSP/Servlets, and more advanced projects 
	like link mappers and translations.</li>
  <li>It should help Bible study through various optional front-ends that 
	are shipped with JSword or separately.</li>
  <li>It should be easliy contributed-to, and easily used.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a list of the people that have contributed code to this project. 
  It would be good to make this list auto-generated from the author tags 
  of the source.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Joe Walker</li>
  <li>Mark Goodwin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Coding Recommendations</h2>

<h4>JDK Versions</h4>
<p>This is all currently being written using JDK 1.3. The basis for this 
  is that (where practical) we will retain support for JDKs where some 
  of our users have no better options. So at the time of writing MacOS 
  only supports JDK1.3, we have people wanting to use JSword on MacOS, 
  so when we want to use JDK1.4 only features (for example roll-over toolbar 
  buttons) we'll use reflection or some other trick to remain compatible 
  with JDK1.3.</p>

<h4>Coding Standards</h4>
<p>The coding standards used on this project so far are very much based 
  on the SUN coding standards. This is some notes on style we are using, 
  some of this deviates from the SUN standard, and some is just extensions 
  to it.</p>

<h5>Packaging</h5>
<p>There is a split between classes that are specific to this project and those that 
  could be usefully employed elsewhere. Generally we should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a much code general as possible</li>
  <li>Only generalize where there is a point - specifically and code that 
	does something Bible specific should not be general</li>
  <li>Never import specific code in generalized code</li>
</ul>
<p> Generalized code exists in <code>org.crosswire</code>. Code specific 
  to this project lives in <code>org.crosswire.jsword</code>.</p>

<p>Also, since there is an MVC relationship between various parts of the code we avoid 
  importing <code>org.crosswire.jsword.view.*</code> in any other code, 
  and avoid importing <code>org.crosswire.jsword.control.*</code> in anything 
  but <code>org.crosswire.jsword.view.*</code></p>

<p>Also any code specific to an interface X should be in a package containing x. For 
  example all swing specific code is in a *swing* package. This helps 
  us in packaging code for a distribution, in excluding other interfaces.</p>

<h5>Bracket Indentation</h5>
<p>The "Sun Way" conserves screen space at the expense of readibility 
  - which given the cost of decent size monitors these days seems silly. 
  A lot of Java code, seems to ignore Sun and do it this way:</p>

<pre>if (something)
{
    func();
}</pre>

<h5>Variable Naming</h5>
<p>Sun recommend using the same convention as for method names. This does 
  confuse method names and variable names. So the suggested use for this 
  project is all lower case names with optional underscores between words. 
  For example <code>word_count</code> or <code>wordcount</code> and not 
  <code>wordCount</code>. The Sun method makes some sense if you intend 
  to use public member variables, however that is generally not recommended 
  behavior.</p>

<h5>Class Ordering</h5>
<p>Variables are not important members of a class so why put them at the top? JSword 
  usage puts them at the bottom.</p>

<h5>Tabbing</h5>
<p>4 space indents are a Good Thing, however using a tab character instead of 4 spaces 
  just causes problems when you want to print, open in a different editor, 
  or want to paste into an html doc using &lt;pre&gt; tags. Everything 
  will look exactly the same if you use spaces instead of tabs.</p>

<h5>Preamble</h5>
<p>All java source should have the following at the end of the class JavaDoc</p>

<p>The result looks something like this from JavaDoc:</p>
