<line title='Introduction'>

You can download the source from <link src='download'>here</link>. This
page gives you links to look at it on the web. If you are not a
programmer then you are probably best <a href='spage'>find something
else to do</a>. This is all computer stuff from here in.
To get a head start into understanding all this lot there are a group of
classes/documents in the docs package that contain only JavaDoc and no
real code, that give an overview on some of the rest. (Effectively
overview.html got too large and spilled out over here)

</line>
<line title='JavaDoc'>

The JavaDoc was produced by a hacked up version of JavaDoc that
generates links to the source, which is very useful. This hack is not
of my invention - it comes from Sun's JavaDoc pages

<line title='The Programs'>

There are several programs to the distribution:
<ul>
  <li><b>ToolShed</b> - a tool for converting Bible data and testing</li>
  <li><b>B</b> - and early desktop prototype, that is probably broken</li>
  <li><b>BApplet</b> - an applet demo</li>
  <li><b>Servlets</b> - Run on the web-server, generating content</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Page</b> - For viewing the Bible on the web</li>
    <li><b>Web</b> - For looking at basic web pages</li>
    <li><b>Source</b> - The source-code viewer</li>
    <li><b>Config*</b> - To configure the look of the other servlets</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<line title='Get it here'>

There are 2 ways of looking at the source.
<ul>
<li>The easy way is to read the <a href='http://www.eireneh.demon.co.uk/projectb'>JavaDoc</a></li>
<li>The hard way is to read the <a href='ssource'>Source</a> in the source servlet</li>
<li>The very hard way is to download the <link src='download'>lot</link> and compile it yourself</li>
</ul>
