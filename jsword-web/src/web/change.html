  </li>
  <li>Support for images.</li>
  <li>Improved the appearance of the NET Bible.</li>
  <li>Improved the support of ThML.</li>
  <li>Improved the handling of passages as they are found as references in modules.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug preventing locked dictionaries from showing correctly</li>
  <li>Fixed potential bugs pointed out by the QA tools FindBugs and PMD</li>
  <li>Fixed miscellaneous bugs found by a scan of all the modules.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Version 1.0.4</strong> - FOURTH UPDATE -
  Webster's Dictionary is now supported. BibleDesktop is now a native Mac OS X application! with a Mac standard disk image.
  The default location of Sword Modules is no longer ~/.jsword on the Mac or on Windows. It is now ~/Library/Application Support/Sword on the Mac
  and ~/Application Data/Sword on Windows. Likewise, the preferences that were stored in
  ~/.jsword have been moved to ~/Library/Application Support/JSword for Mac and ~/Application Data/JSword for Windows.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Version 1.0.3</strong> - THIRD UPDATE -
  Most of the changes are to make the viewing of Bibles better and to support new Bibles that will be available soon,
  notably an update to the KJV, the first release of ESV (thanks Crossway!), the NET Bible (thanks Bible.org) and the NASB (thanks Lockman).<br/>
  This release also adds support for locked books. Once a locked book is installed you can go to the "Installed Books" tab
  on the installer, click unlock and enter the unlock key.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Version 1.0.2</strong> - SECOND UPDATE -
  Our apologies to our Mac users, since only the most recent version of the Mac OS has Java 5.0.
  This release no longer requires Java 5.0, but rather 1.4 or higher.
  This release also changes the internal JSword API, merging VerseBase into Key and using an iterator rather than an array as a collection of verses. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>Version 1.0.1</strong> - FIRST UPDATE -
  This release provides a few bug fixes and requires Java 5.0.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Version 1.0</strong> - FIRST FULL RELEASE - 
  Since the last release we have been working on small
  bugs and features to make BibleDesktop more useable.
    <ul>
      <li>We now provide a Windows installer that does not require you to download Java first.</li>
      <li>Java WebStart now works for Fedora Core Linux.</li>

      <li>You can now use BibleDesktop's book installer with a proxy.</li>
      <li>The installer now lists Daily Devotional and Glossaries separately from Dictionaries.
          With this now each book (or module, if you prefer) has its own colorful icon and
          BibleDesktop now classifies books the same as Sword.</li>

      <li>Daily Devotions are now fully supported.<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>The list of days now show the day and the month's name.</li>
          <li>Any installed Daily Devotional can be selected to show the day's readings.</li>
          <li>When selecting a Daily Devotional it will show the day's readings.</li>
	    </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Viewing of Bible passages has been greatly improved.
        <ul>
	      <li>Tabs can now be reused. This is determined by an option. When set,
	          clicking on a verse reference will open the reference in the current tab.</li>
	      <li>The default viewing options create a less cluttered view.</li>
	      <li>Notes now have meaningful text markers.</li>
	      <li>Words marked with two Stongs number now show all (rather than just the first).</li>
	      <li>Word morphology is now supported for books that have it.</li>
	    </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>Search has been significantly improved.
        <ul>
	      <li>Search now shows the number of verses found.</li>
	      <li>Search results can be prioritized.</li>
	      <li>Book names like <quote>Song of Solomon</quote> and <quote>Revelation of John</quote> are now acceptable for search input.</li>
	      <li>History is maintained. You can go forward or back in the list of passages you have visited. It is not perfected yet.</li>
	    </ul>
      </li>

	  <li>More useful About dialog.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    from the JSword Core, and creating projects like jsword-web, common and
    bibledesktop-web in support. Removal of JAXB for JDOM and lots of work
    trimming things down to size and simplifying.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.97</strong> - THE SECOND BETA - make the API use Book
    more than the other interfaces, new module installer and lots of bug fixing.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.96</strong> - THE FIRST BETA - Work on JNLP, an new
    website and lots more work on Sword drivers, OSIS, JAXB.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.95</strong> - THE NAMELESS - Major work to flesh out
    Dictionary and Concordance along with a much fuller implentation of the
	Sword drivers.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.90</strong> - JSWORD - Merging with JSword</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.80</strong> - SWORD1 - Troy just did a call for Java
    Bible programs from which to make jsword. There have been many updates -
    Logging API updates, a new GUI framework and work on the WordNet thesaurus.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.75</strong> - THE MAP - New Mapper application, lots
    of tuning, tweaks and fixes.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.73</strong> - THE MUTE - Lots of tweaks to speed things
    up, history bug fixed, new PassageTally functionality, SerBible is now the
    preferred format.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.72</strong> - THE SHOUT 2 - New lib project, many fixes
    to servlets and Project.java, Source syntax colouring, Office interface revamp.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.71</strong> - THE UNANNOUNCED - 2nd major upload, minor
    bug fixes on version 0.7</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.7</strong> - THE ANNOUNCED - Lots of testing, tidying
    up, and organizing. The Book package has been majorly re-worked, and many
    of the packages have been sorted out.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.6</strong> - THE SERVANT - New servlet interface. Lots
    of work on the config i/f lots of tidying up. New web pages, &amp; mail list.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.5</strong> - THE CABBAGE - Lots of changes - RawBible,
    Search.bestMatch(), SelfTestBase, Some I18N, Config. Some GUI work.</li>

    an applet for demo to Sword people.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.4</strong> - THE MIX - Merged passage and dictionary.
    The dictionary package was shrinking, and being simplified, and the classes
    Passage and Strongs considered core. TallyBoard renamed PassageTally and
    made to implement Passage. Outstanding work - Events and Editable book names/I18N.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.3</strong> - THE SHOUT - The search system wanted TallyBoard,
    and I revised Passage being a Collection at the same time. The only remaining
    functionality requests are Sorting out Events, and I18N. Some work on Version.
    Search - I'm beginning to like this design. I just added ( ) in a few hours
    without any major changes to the engine at all. I need to tighten up the
    docs and sort out GrammarParamWord.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.2</strong> - THE PLATFORM - Passage - I need to spend
    some time on the other bits of the system. The TODO list for this is getting
    more and more streched. What is here is good though. Search - Been through
    about 100 different search Engine designs, and I'm still not happy. However
    a working engine is better than none at all.</li>

  <li><strong>Version 0.1</strong> - THE TODDLER - Proof of concept. Quickly
    hacked-up GUI. Passage - About 80% of the stuff I plan for this library is
    complete. There are bugs. The most notable of which is that Jude 2 does not
    exist - you must use Jude 1:2, and so on. Included is full JavaDoc and a
    fairly exhaustive SelfTest module. Search - very hacked up and needs re-writing.</li>
</ul>
