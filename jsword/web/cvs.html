<h1>CVS Access</h1>

<p>
  CVS is hosted at crosswire. The CVS root is:<br />
  <code>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.crosswire.org:/cvs/jsword</code><br />
  And the password is "anonymous". If you need to get at the code but are not
  sure about CVS then join the mailing list and we'll sort something out. The
  module to checkout is 'jsword', so if you are using the command line you would
  do something like this (having first set your CVSROOT:<br />
  <code>cvs checkout jsword</code>.<br />
  There is also a support module containing 3rd-party source jars, tools to
  build the website, UML models and a default KJV module. To get access to this
  you will need to check-out <code>jsword-support</code>.
</p>

<h1>After CVS checkout</h1>

<p>
  <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
  When you first check files out of CVS you should run ant using the all target
  to generate required source files from the OSIS XML Schema. These are required
  for most IDEs.
