<line title='Introduction'>

Welcome to Eireneh. Stuff to look at - on this site the only thing of
note is <a href='sweb?page=home'>Project B</a>.
<br/>Project B is a platform for various Bible programs using Java.
It will support desktop applications like the On-Line Bible, there is a
<a href='spage'>Web interface</a>, some add-in macros for MS Word.
Other interfaces are in development.

<line title='Project B'>

There is a little <a href='/applet.html'>demo applet</a>, that is not
very inspiring. The point is to show this stuff running in web browsers
as well as web servers.<br/>
There is an alternative home page <a href='/index2.html'>here</a>. It
was going to be the normal home page, however it is probably a bit
silly to have as an introduction.

<line title='Other Stuff'>

Other pages that are of note:
A while back I help to get <a href='http://www.christadelphian.org'>
Christadelphian.Org</a> set up. There is a related project called
<a href='http://www.crosswire.org/'>Sword</a>. The idea is the same
however this is C++ based and not Java based.<br />
The mailing lists, forums, bug-lists, some downloads, and so on are
hosted by SourceForge.<a href="http://sourceforge.net">
