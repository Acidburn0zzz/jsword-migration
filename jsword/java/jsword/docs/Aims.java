This is document describes the aims of the project. 
<p>
Originally there was a problem - the available Bible study tools did not
work very well. The OLB had a terrible interface, I'd not heard of Sword
and Theophilos, and the other projects were not Free in any sense, beer
or speech. With the exception of Sword none of them are Speech Free even
now.
<p>
I wanted to be able to do more word studies, and have a platform to build
on. And I also wanted everything to be free so that others would not have
to write the platform.
<p>
So I mucked around with VB and Access for a while and then around
Christmas 1998 I started this project. It is now 6 months on and I have
just released Version 0.5, and I need to think where I am going.

<h3>Aims</h3>

Project B should:<ul>

<li>be a base so that I can do some more work on projects like DoE, and
    the AutoTranslation.

<li>be designed to interract with other projects, as a base, as a peer
    and as a freeloader

<li>enable more powerful word study

<li>enable talk writing, that is linked to the Bible more

<li>be Internet friendly

<li>be easliy contributed-to. Though growth of program is more important
    than growth of user base

</ul>

<p>
To have a free Java Bible program.
