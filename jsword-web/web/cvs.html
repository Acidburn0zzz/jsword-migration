<h1>CVS Access</h1>
<p>
  CVS is hosted at crosswire. The CVS root is:<br />
  <code>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.crosswire.org:/cvs/jsword</code><br />
  And the password is "anonymous". If you need to get at the code but are not
  sure about CVS then join the mailing list and we'll sort something out. The
  module to checkout is 'jsword', so if you are using the command line you would
  do something like this (having first set your CVSROOT:<br />
  <code>cvs checkout jsword</code>.<br />
  There is also a support module containing 3rd-party source jars, tools to
  build the website, UML models and a default KJV module. To get access to this
  you will need to check-out <code>jsword-support</code>.

<h1>SVN Access</h1>
<p>
  At some stage in the near future will should be changing from CVS to SVN.
  More on the SVN connection details when the repository has been converted.
