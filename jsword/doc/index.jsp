            <h1>JSword</h1>
            <p>JSword is a port of Sword to Java. Since it is written in Java (JDK 1.2+) it will 
              run on most computers. Currently we regularly test on Windows and Linux, 
              but it ought to work in Macs, and given some interface work, set-top 
              boxes and PDAs.</p>
            <p>JSword is open source software so it is freely available to anyone. 
              It is licensed under the <a href="api\docs\Licence.html">GPL</a>.</p>
            <h2>How to find out more</h2>
            <p>There is a page of <a href="screenshot.jsp">screenshots</a> showing what JSword 
              looks like, and a page of recent <a href="news.jsp">news</a>. If you 
              want JSword NOW you will need to use CVS to <a href="download.jsp">download</a>
