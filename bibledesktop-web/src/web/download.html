<h1>Sword Modules</h1>
<p>
  These downloads do not contain Sword modules (Bibles, Commentaries, Dictionaries, Daily Devotionals, General Books...).
  When you start BibleDesktop for the first time you will be prompted to download the books you want.
  If you are using a proxy, please set your proxy settings with "Edit Sites".
</p>
<p> 
  Most Sword modules are working with BibleDesktop. So, please report any that fail.
</p>
<p> 
  At this time, the Personal Commentary does not work.
</p>

<h1>Nightly Build</h1>
<p>
  Every night we automatically create a new nightly release which may have all
  sorts of strange bugs that could wipe out civilization as we know it.
  You'll need an installation of Java as for the stable release of Bible Desktop.
</p>

<h1>Note on WebStart</h1>
<p>
  WebStart works on all platforms and does not require an active connection to the internet after the program
  is run for the first time. To use WebStart you will need to have Java on your computer. You can get Java from 
  <a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a>. Once Java is installed, you can run BibleDesktop by
  clicking on the WebStart button. The first time you run, you will be asked if you trust our application.
  We have signed it as a "Thawte Freemail Member".
  When you are offered a choice to create desktop shortcuts do so. It will make running BibleDesktop so much
  easier. You won't need to come back to this page.
</p>

<h1>Note on Linux</h1>
<p>
  Most distributions of Linux pose a challenge to running Java programs:
  Most do not come with a version of Java that can run BibleDesktop.
  You will need to
  <a href="/jsword/linuxjava.html">obtain and install Java</a>
  before trying to run BibleDesktop.
