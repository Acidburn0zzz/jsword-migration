<h1>Introducing Bible Desktop</h1>
<p>
  Bible Desktop is a Free Bible Study tool that will run almost anywhere.<br/>

  easy. Bible Desktop uses the JSword project to read modules in Sword format
  so there is a huge range of Bibles, Commentaries and Dictionaries - one of the
  largest collections available.
</p>
<p>
  Bible Desktop is open source software so it is freely available to anyone.
  It is licensed under the <a href="api/gnu/gpl/License.html">GPL</a>.
