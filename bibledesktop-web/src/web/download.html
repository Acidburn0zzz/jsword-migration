<h2>WebStart</h2>
<p>
  WebStart works on all platforms and does not require an active connection to the internet after the program
  is run for the first time. To use WebStart you will need to have Java on your computer. You can get Java from 
  <a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a>. Once Java is installed, you can run BibleDesktop by
  clicking on the "Big Blue Button" below. The first time you run, you will be asked if you trust our application.
  When you are offered a choice to create desktop shortcuts do so. It will make running BibleDesktop so much
  easier. You won't need to come back to this page.

<h1>Nightly Release</h1>
<p>
  Every night we automatically create a new nightly release which may have all
  sorts of strange bugs that could wipe out civilization as we know it.
  You'll need an installation of Java as for the stable release of Bible Desktop.

<h1>Note on Linux</h1>
<p>
  Most distributions of Linux pose a challenge to running Java programs:
  They do not come with a version of Java that can run BibleDesktop.
  You will need to
  <a href="/jsword/linuxjava.html">obtain and install Java</a>
  before trying to run BibleDesktop.
</p>

<h1>Binary Downloads</h1>

  available in the following formats. The links below are all for version 1.0.4,

  These downloads do not contain Sword modules (Bibles, Commentaries, Dictionaries, Daily Devotionals, ...).

  If you are using a proxy, please set your proxy settings with "Edit Sites".
</p>
<p> 
  Most Sword modules are working with BibleDesktop. So, please report any that fail.
