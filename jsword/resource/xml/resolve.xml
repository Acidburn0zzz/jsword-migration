This is a very quick little demo of the Passage foundation class. Passage
provides classes like Verse, VerseRange, Passage (which is a collection
of Verses), and Book (a utility class that can tell you how many verses
there are in a chapter, and so on).

<br/>

You can get a good example of it's work here. Try typing
&quot;gen 1 1&quot; into the text box (and press return) The applet will
parse the text display a message to show that it has understood (or not
as the case may be) and re-write the reference to a more standard form
(in this case &quot;Gen 1:1&quot;)

<br/>

The applet will work with some quite complex references (for example
&quot;Mat 3:5-8,10&quot;, &quot;Rev 22&quot;, &quot;Jude 6&quot;, 
&quot;1 Ti3 16-2Ti 1:$&quot;, &quot;Exo 1:5,4,3&quot;, &quot;Luk 1:1-80&quot;, 
&quot;Psa 1:1-$:$&quot;) Please tell me if you get any surprises:

I'm afraid that I don't have a copy of Netscape to hand so I have no idea if
it will work in Netscape. IE4 is fine.
