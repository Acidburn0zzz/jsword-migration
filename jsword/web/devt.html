<h1>Getting Involved</h1>
<h2>CVS Access</h2>
<p> There is a mailing list at <a href="mailto:jsword-devel@crosswire.org">jsword-devel@crosswire.org</a>.
  To join, please fill out your email address in on <a href="http://www.crosswire.org/mailman/listinfo/jsword-devel">this</a> form.
  Or you can read the archives <a href='http://www.crosswire.org/pipermail/jsword-devel/'>here</a></p>
<p> CVS is also hosted at crosswire. The CVS root is:<br />
  <code>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.crosswire.org:/cvs/jsword</code> <br />
  And the password is "anonymous". If you need to get at the code but are not
  sure about CVS then join the mailing list and we'll sort something out. </p>
<p> When you first check files out of CVS you should run ant using the all target
  to generate all the source files required for tools like eclipse. </p>
