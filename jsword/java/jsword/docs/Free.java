This is some notes on giving software - particularly Biblical software
away freely.

<h3>Biblical Principles</h3>
Some references that are of note:<ul>
  <li><b>Mat 10:8</b> - "<i>Freely as you have received, Freely give<i>"
      I think that most people would agree that hording money and
      refusing to give any away to help the poor is not a good thing. So
      I don't understand how this changes when we are talking about the
      word of God instead of money. Surely we should be all the more keen
      to let the word of God, and the study of it be more freely
      accessible? So why are we so obsessed with charging for it?</li>
  <li><b>Act 8:9-25</b> - The selling of access of God, Simon was roundly
      repremanded for his attempts to buy access to God. Is what we do
      all that different?</li>
</ul>

<p>If people benefit from using your program, and if there are people that
are not using it because they can't have it freely, then by charging for
the program you are hindering the study of the Bible.

<h3>When Is It OK To Charge?</h3>
This does not mean that charging for anything is evil. We need to eat,
and need money to buy food with.
<b>2Th 3:10</b> - "<i>if any would not work, neither should he eat.</i>"
Now note that this reference is aimed at preventing lazyness, and I do
not advocate lazyness, but it does make the point that getting paid for
working is not wrong, And if your work is to do the work of God, then
it is not wrong to be paid for it. The priests in the old testament were
paid in donations for their work.
<br />However few people's primary salary is for priestly/deconly duties.

<h3>Objections</h3>
<ul>
<li>How can you expect people to spend a long time on a great work of any
    kind, Biblical or otherwise, if there is no financial return.
    <br>Truly great works are rarely created for financial gain - more
    often for the love of the work itself. The modern music industry is a
    good example. If you compare Mozart & Beethoven with the Spice Girls
    and Michael Jackson for the creation of truly great works, you would
    have to conclude that money is not necessary for great works, and may
    even hinder it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Related Topics: The Law</h3>
<p>What does the law say about copyright and free distribution? To
oversimplify matters to the point of them being almost incorrect the law
says that 70 years after the death of the author, the works become public
domain, and free from copyright restrictions. There are many national and
other variations though. Under US law, works created before 1923 are all
copyright free.

<h3>Related Topics: The Internet</h3>
<p>Allowing free redistribution of software is becomming very common on
the Internet. Companies like IBM, Netscape, AOL, SUN and Apple and many
others all distribute software openly, without cost using the Internet.
<p>There is much debate about why. Some people argue that is makes good
economic sense (at this is the argument that swayed the companies listed
above). Advocates of this philosophy rally under a banner entitled "Open
Source". See <a href="www.opensource.org">opensource.org</a>
<br>Another school of thought argues that preventing others from
accessing software which would cost you nothing to distribute is morally
wrong. Advocates of this philosophy rally under a banner entitled "Free
Software". See <a href="www.gnu.org">The GNU project</a>

<h3>Does Free Software Make Economic Sense?</h3>
<p>The key difference between free software and free beer is that for me
to give someone else some beer, costs me some beer. For me to give
someone else some software does not cost me anything.
<p>We could debate the cost of CD cases, or phone bills, but the central
point is that if I wish to distribute software, I can do so by sticking
it on an FTP site, at nigh zero cost to me. And done once - that is all
of the costs for ever. So to distribure to 1000 is the same cost (~0) as
to distribute to 1.

Think of it like this:<ul>

<li>A has a problem, can being a programmer, solves this by writing a
    bit of software. Problem solved. A is happy. It has cost A some time
    to develop the software, but it was worth it to solve the problem.</li>
<li>B has the same problem. B is not a programmer. Does A do a deal with
    B to distribute the software?</li>
<li>Since the cost to A of the deal is zero, any payment for the deal
    will be 100% profit. A could give the software away for no cost and
    not lose anything. B could be getting the software from A. What is
    it worth to B? Suppose that solving the problem will benefit B by X
    pounds. B will be willing to pay anything up to X pounds.</li>
<li>So any deal that involves B paying A between 0 and X pounds for the
    software will be profit for both of them. So what is the right level?
    </li>
<li>If there are lots of As - people that have solved the same problem
    then very quickly the price will tend to zero. In a buyers market,
    simple market forces will drive down prices until the vendors margins
    are small, and since the price is all profit, so the price tends to
    zero.</li>
<li>If there are lots of Bs - lots of people with a problem that needs
    solving then for a while B coulds make a huge profit, for zero
    effort. 2 things would prevent this from happening. The vendors
    market would turn into a buyers market very quickly, and B would
    become very unpopular. The only way that B can keep the stranglehold
    is to make customers buy something like brand image instead of
    software, obviously this can not be done honestly so you need to
    watch out the the US DoJ don't sue you if you take this path :)</li>
<li>So since a vendors market can not last for long, all software prices
    will tend to zero over time. The only way to maintain prices is to
    repeatedly invent new versions to counteract falling prices with
    greater problems solved. But the trend for all of this is to zero
    cost software.</li>
<li>This formulae works even if A was not a programmer and had to pay
    C to write the software for A. The only difference is that C's
    initial investment is money, where A's is time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>I agree with GPL/FSF/RMS for Biblical works &quot;Freely Give ...&quot;.
However I think RMS fails to take into account the cost/benefit equation
of the person receiving the code so I'm not always in the GPL/FSF/RMS
camp philosophically for non-Biblical works. Zero cost sharing does not
make sharing a moral right.</p>
