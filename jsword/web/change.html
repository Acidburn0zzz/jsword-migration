<h2>Change History</h2>
<p>The following is the broad outline of the version of JSword and Project-B
  (the old name for JSword).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Version 0.95</strong> - AKA 1.0b1 - Major work to flesh out
    Dictionary and Concordance along with a much fuller implentation of the
	Sword drivers.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.90</strong> - JSWORD - Merging with JSword</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.80</strong> - SWORD1 - Troy just did a call for Java
    Bible programs from which to make jsword. There have been many updates -
    Logging API updates, a new GUI framework and work on the WordNet thesaurus.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.75</strong> - THE MAP - New Mapper application, lots
    of tuning, tweaks and fixes.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.73</strong> - THE MUTE - Lots of tweaks to speed things
    up, history bug fixed, new PassageTally functionality, SerBible is now the
    preferred format.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.72</strong> - THE SHOUT 2 - New lib project, many fixes
    to servlets and Project.java, Source syntax colouring, Office interface revamp.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.71</strong> - THE UNANNOUNCED - 2nd major upload, minor
    bug fixes on version 0.7</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.7</strong> - THE ANNOUNCED - Lots of testing, tidying
    up, and organizing. The Book package has been majorly re-worked, and many
    of the packages have been sorted out.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.6</strong> - THE SERVANT - New servlet interface. Lots
    of work on the config i/f lots of tidying up. New web pages, &amp; mail list.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.5</strong> - THE CABBAGE - Lots of changes - RawBible,
    Search.bestMatch(), SelfTestBase, Some I18N, Config. Some GUI work.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.46</strong> - THE FOREIGN APPLET - Quick release as
    v0.45 with I18N for the Germans.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.45</strong> - THE APPLET - Quick release to get together
    an applet for demo to Sword people.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.4</strong> - THE MIX - Merged passage and dictionary.
    The dictionary package was shrinking, and being simplified, and the classes
    Passage and Strongs considered core. TallyBoard renamed PassageTally and
    made to implement Passage. Outstanding work - Events and Editable book names/I18N.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.3</strong> - THE SHOUT - The search system wanted TallyBoard,
    and I revised Passage being a Collection at the same time. The only remaining
    functionality requests are Sorting out Events, and I18N. Some work on Version.
    Search - I'm beginning to like this design. I just added ( ) in a few hours
    without any major changes to the engine at all. I need to tighten up the
    docs and sort out GrammarParamWord.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.2</strong> - THE PLATFORM - Passage - I need to spend
    some time on the other bits of the system. The TODO list for this is getting
    more and more streched. What is here is good though. Search - Been through
    about 100 different search Engine designs, and I'm still not happy. However
    a working engine is better than none at all.</li>
  <li><strong>Version 0.1</strong> - THE TODDLER - Proof of concept. Quickly
    hacked-up GUI. Passage - About 80% of the stuff I plan for this library is
    complete. There are bugs. The most notable of which is that Jude 2 does not
    exist - you must use Jude 1:2, and so on. Included is full JavaDoc and a
    fairly exhaustive SelfTest module. Search - very hacked up and needs re-writing.</li>
</ul>
