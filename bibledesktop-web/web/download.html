<h1>Official Stable Release</h1>
<p>
  The latest official release of Bible Desktop is 1.0. We provide you a choice of running
  BibleDesktop using WebStart or a standard installer.
</p>
<h2>WebStart</h2>
<p>
  WebStart works on all platforms and does not require an active connection to the internet arter the program is run for the
  first time. To use WebStart you will need to have Java on your computer. You can get Java from 
  <a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a>. Once Java is installed, you can run BibleDesktop by
  clicking on the "Big Blue Button" below. You will be asked if you trust our download. When you are offered
  a choice to create desktop shortcuts do so. It will make running BibleDesktop so much easier. You won't
  need to come back to this page.

<h2>Standard Installers</h2>
<p>
  The following installers provide you with the installation your are familiar. (At this time, we only have a Window's Installer).
  Just download to your desktop and run the program. Note, for the Windows Installer, if you don't have Java that's ok. Our
  installer will get it for you.

<h1>Note on Linux Fedora Core 3</h1>
<p>
  Fedora poses 2 challenges to running Java programs. First, it does not come with
  a version of Java that can run BibleDesktop. Second, because of a problem in Sun's
  Java, the WebStart buttons above will not work. Follow the instructions below to
  get BibleDesktop up and running under Fedora.
