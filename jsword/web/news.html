have a new AboutDialog and a Books dialog.</p>

<h3>20 Apr 2003</h3>
<p>JSword 1.0 beta 1 has just been cut. See the <a href="download.jsp">download</a>
page for more details.</p>

<h3>17 Apr 2003</h3>
<p>Initial Sword Dictionary support hits CVS. This was the last major barrier
before 1.0 beta so we hope to create a new release soon.</p>

<h3>03 Apr 2003</h3>
<p>New nightly downloads available at the <a href="download.jsp">Download</a> page.</p>

<h3>17 Feb 2003</h3>
<p>There is a new API Primer link on the left. The API Primer describes how to
go about reading and formatting data from JSword, using Bibles, Commentaries and
Dictionaries.</p>

<h3>15 Feb 2003</h3>
<p>Sword drivers are now fixed in CVS once more amd we've made lots of GUI bug
fixes. The only work that I know of before we release a beta version is to
add Dictionary and Commentary support to the Sword drivers.</p>

<h3>25 Jan 2003</h3>
<p>Bug update to the splash screen which means that the completion percentages
are computed automagically, and we've fixed a few UI bugs with it too.</p>

<h3>03 Jan 2003</h3>
<p>New OSIS pages and the beginnings of Dictionary and Lexicon support are just
going into CVS.</p>

<h3>15 Oct 2002</h3>
<p>Sword module compatibility hits CVS. The number of Bible versions available
to Sword users goes up something like 10-fold overnight.</p>

<h3>13 Oct 2002</h3>
<p>Bug Fixes! The WebStart version of JSword should now work most places. It
is known to work on Windows, Linux and OS-X.</p>

<h3>11 Oct 2002</h3>
<p>Added a new JNLP section. JSword should now work over WebStart. For the time
being the download comes with a complete Bible version so it is a large download,
but we have a plan to reduce this. There are also some reports of failures
on Windows.</p>

<h3>21 Sep 2002</h3>
<p>Currently working on releasing a beta for JSword v1.0. The remaining tasks
(other than bug fixes) are some GUI polishing - mostly to sort out the config
dialog and fixing Sword module compatibility. Updating the website was on the
list, but I guess if you can read this ...</p>
