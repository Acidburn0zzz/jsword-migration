Instructions on how to upgrade Lucene from one version to another.

Obtain the most recent version of Lucene from
   http://lucene.apache.org

Unzip the binary file into the jar directory.
Copy the src zip into the new lucene directory.
Copy the needed contrib jars to the root of this directory.
These are:
   contrib/analyzers/common/lucene-analyzers
   contrib/analyzers/smartcn/lucene-smartcn
   contrib/snowball/lucene-snowball

In the new directory, remove the following:
   All the Javadoc jars (*/**/*-javadoc.jar)
   docs
   lib
   src (This could be zipped rather than downloading the src zip)

Change the references to the old directory to the new directory in the build path.

In SVN remove the old Lucene directory.

If installing a x.9 release, look for deprecations and replace them.
