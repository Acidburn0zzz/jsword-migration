<h1>Design Overview</h1>

<p>
  This is an overview of JSword that explains how the Book and Bible interfaces
  are arranged and explains some of the design decisions.
</p>

<p>
  The most important thing any Bible program does is to access Bible data, and
  in more general terms, book data. There may be many different sources of data
  - Bibles stored in different formats, or even on remote systems, dictionaries,
  lexicons and so on. It would be good (where appropriate) to be able to treat
  them all similarly without needing to reinvent the wheel too often. We should
  be able to use inheritance to specialize where needed. So we start by creating
  an interface that is common to all 'Books' but that allows us to do as much
  as possible. The first goal is to read data and to be able to direct where
  to read from with some sort of pointer system. So we start with an interface
  that looks like this:
</p>

<pre>interface Book
{
    BookData getData(Key ptr);
}</pre>

<p>
  Before we look at what BookData and Key looks like, a Book will need to be
  able to do 2 other things:<br/>
  Firstly tell us about itself: what it is called, where it comes from and so
  on - MetaData about the Book itself. Secondly help us to find stuff by searching.
</p>

<pre>interface Book
{
    BookData getData(Key ptr);
    BookMetaData getMetaData();
    Key search(Search word);
}</pre>

<p>
  JSword has split searching away from implmenting the core Book interface so
  there is a Searcher interface that allows a search engine to index a Book and
  provide search results.
</p>

<p>
  This interface can be implemented several times, once by something that reads
  Sword format data, once by something that reads JSword format data, and so
  on. The users, and indeed the developers of the front ends do not want to know
  about the various different implementors and what implementations need to be
  looked at. So we can use a couple of classes to fix this. If you like GoF patterns,
  an AbstractFactory:
</p>

<pre>interface Books
{
    List getBooks();
    List getBooks(BookFilter filter);
	void addBooksListener(BooksListener li);
	void removeBooksListener(BooksListener li);
}</pre>

<p>
  Both getBooks() methods allow you to iterate over the Books known to the whole
  system (Books), and to Filter out the uninteresting Books. There is a BookFilters
  class that contains a set of default implentations.<br/>
  The List returned by getBooks() contains BookMetaData objects and not the Books
  themselves because creating a Book may be a time and memory consuming process
  (indexes to be loaded etc) So these BookMetaData objects need to be able to
  give access to the Book they represent.
</p>

<pre>interface BookMetaData
{
    Book getBook();
}</pre>

<p>
  Before we move on to what BookData and Key look like, I have intentionally
  ignored 2 issues: Encrypted works - some works will need to be encrypted -
  however the finding of keys or deobfustication will be done within the Driver
  so we don't need to worry about it too much. Configuration - some Books will
  need configuring before they will work, maybe with encryption keys, maybe with
  directories under which to find information. Each BookDriver will need to take
  care of configuring the Books that it creates we don't attempt to do anything
  more fancy even though there are parts of JSword that have implemented a generic
  configuration system.
</p>

<p>
  BookData and Key are related. BookData describes the actual Book text (for
  example "In the beginning God created ...") and Key describes where that text
  comes from (for example "Gen 1:1")
</p>

<p>
  BookData first. We do not want to force users of this code to use it in any
  specific way, so BookData should describe the text in as much detail as possible
  without forcing how that text is used. The final display could be a PDA, a
  web browser, a matching verse list or a full-blow GUI display. This to me rules
  out RTF, HTML and plain text, as they are all either display specific (RTF/HTML)
  or low detail (text), and makes me think that XML along with some standard
  converters to turn XML into RTF/HTML/PDF/text/blah is the best choice.<br />
  This has the added benefit that it allows us to specify not just what output
  format is required, but also how that transformation is done, the fonts and
  layout details of the produced RTF/HTML are all very configurable.<br/>
  It also turn out to be very easy in Java simply by using the XSL libraries
  produced by Sun and Apache. XSL libraries are freely available in all good
  languages.
</p>

<p>
  Key is used to request BookData from a Book and are also used as a reply from
  a search - so we have Keys that tell us where the word "aaron" exists in a
  particular Book. For the case of a Bible a Key could look like this: "Gen 1:1,
  Isa 45:2, Rev 20:4", for the case of a dictionary a pointer would be like this: "aaron",
  or for a BookDriver that contained sermons: "page 153, para 4-5".
  <br/>
  There is no requirement on Key for them to apply only to single results, or
  even for the results to be contiguous (it would be of little use in search
  results if this was to be the case).
</p>

<p>
  For the Bible case a Key is a collection of verses, and JSword has a set of
  classes called Verse, VerseRange and Passage which are a fundamental building
  block in this. The Passage package has classes to do all sorts of useful
  manipulations to lists of verses.
