<h1>News</h1>

<h3>18 Aug 2004</h3>
<p>Bible Desktop is born! We are just finishing a huge job of splitting J-Sword
into component projects, the websites are deparate CVS modules as is Bible
Desktop, the Common library, Bible Mapper and the Support data.</p>

<h3>25 May 2004</h3>
<p>We've just finished getting rid of JAXB and replacing it with JDOM. In
doing so the size of the BibleDesktop is well under half what it used to be!</p>

<h3>5 May 2004</h3>
<p>We' have separated the UI into a separate project called BibleDesktop and
created new modules in CVS and so on. This process will take a while until we
have finished sorting out the grey areas.</p>

<h3>05 Apr 2004</h3>
<p>J-Sword 0.9.7 has just landed. It includes many many bug fixes, mostly
thanks to DM. This will be the last release where the Swing GUI is bundled
with the rest of J-Sword, the intention is to split things out a bit from here</p>

<h3>20 Mar 2004</h3>
<p>Check out the new WebStart installation. Much improved.</p>

<h3>20 Jan 2004</h3>
<p>Module installation is new and starting to work properly.</p>

<h3>08 Nov 2003</h3>
<p>The current focus is on tidying up the GUI - the latest nightly builds now
have a new AboutDialog and a Books dialog.</p>

<h3>04 Nov 2003</h3>
<p>JSword 0.9.6 has just been cut. There is now a ZeroG installer.
See the <a href="download.jsp">download</a> page for more details.</p>

<h3>28 Sep 2003</h3>
<p>Lots of work on the code to read Sword modules, the test harness now reads all
the Sword modules I have and can iron out many data inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>20 Apr 2003</h3>
<p>JSword 0.9.5 has just been cut. See the <a href="download.jsp">download</a>
page for more details.</p>

<h3>17 Apr 2003</h3>
<p>Initial Sword Dictionary support hits CVS. This was the last major barrier
before 1.0 beta so we hope to create a new release soon.</p>

<h3>03 Apr 2003</h3>
<p>New nightly downloads available at the <a href="download.jsp">Download</a> page.</p>

<h3>17 Feb 2003</h3>
<p>There is a new API Primer link on the left. The API Primer describes how to
go about reading and formatting data from JSword, using Bibles, Commentaries and
Dictionaries.</p>

<h3>15 Feb 2003</h3>
<p>Sword drivers are now fixed in CVS once more amd we've made lots of GUI bug
fixes. The only work that I know of before we release a beta version is to
add Dictionary and Commentary support to the Sword drivers.</p>

<h3>25 Jan 2003</h3>
<p>Bug update to the splash screen which means that the completion percentages
are computed automagically, and we've fixed a few UI bugs with it too.</p>

<h3>03 Jan 2003</h3>
<p>New OSIS pages and the beginnings of Dictionary and Lexicon support are just
going into CVS.</p>

<h3>15 Oct 2002</h3>
<p>Sword module compatibility hits CVS. The number of Bible versions available
to Sword users goes up something like 10-fold overnight.</p>

<h3>13 Oct 2002</h3>
<p>Bug Fixes! The WebStart version of JSword should now work most places. It
is known to work on Windows, Linux and OS-X.</p>

<h3>11 Oct 2002</h3>
<p>Added a new JNLP section. JSword should now work over WebStart. For the time
being the download comes with a complete Bible version so it is a large download,
but we have a plan to reduce this. There are also some reports of failures
on Windows.</p>

<h3>21 Sep 2002</h3>
<p>Currently working on releasing a beta for JSword v1.0. The remaining tasks
(other than bug fixes) are some GUI polishing - mostly to sort out the config
dialog and fixing Sword module compatibility. Updating the website was on the
list, but I guess if you can read this ...</p>
