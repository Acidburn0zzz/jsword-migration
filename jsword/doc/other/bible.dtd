<!-- A reference has a book, chapter and verse numbers (all counting from 1)
and it might be a new paragraph. Inside a reference is a set of inspired text
or uninspired text elements. We can also override the version settting on the
bible element here. Internally this is referred to as a Verse since it only
ever applies to one verse. Here calling it a Verse is confusing with the v
attribute, to ref remains. -->

defined ones are:
  small - indicates 'less important' text (some RSVs)
  christ - red letter editions
  poetry - all modern versions change format for poetry
  clarify - KJV and NKJV use italics for clarifying text
  quote - It could be useful to have all spoken words separated
