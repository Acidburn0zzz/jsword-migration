<p>Project B is a platform for various Bible programs using
Java - It will support desktop applications like the On-Line Bible and Sword,
there is a Servlet interface, some add-in macros for MS Word and other
interfaces are in development - It is freely redistributable (licensed under the
GPL).</p>

<p>The most recent release is version v0.6. It incorporates
most of the features of the On-Line Bible, although it is still beta software.
The extra features that are planned and under development are:
<ul>
  <li><b>HTML Display</b>:
    Biblical text is currently displayed using HTML. This allows us to generate
    reference links. It is also highly customizable using XSL so that we can make
    AV text look like an Oxford AV Bible, and an NIV look like a H&amp;S NIV -
    or visa versa.</li>
  <li><b>Powerful Word Study Aids</b>:
    Using a HTML links I plan a set of Word Study pages that detail
    words translated to and from a selected word or strongs number. This has
    been implemented as a prototype using VB/Access and Excel! A Java and HTML
    version will much more useful.</li>
  <li><b>Intelligent Search</b>:
    So that you can search for phrases like &quot;For God so loves the world&quot;
    and get a match. Most searches will fail. (The 4th word is loved not loves).
    This is currently working. We have extension project planned for next year
    to extend this to query wizard technology where we can ask questions
    &quot;Where was Jesus born?&quot; and we find verses that attempt to answer
    the question.</li>
  <li><b>Incremental Download</b>:
    A problem with most current versions is that they are practically difficult to
    download, due to their size. This is not a feature that many authors want to
    solve, as it helps boost CD sales. This is planned but not under active
    development.<br />
    I believe that there should be an smooth functionality/download curve: <ul>
      <li><b>Servlet</b>:
        0 code download. All code executes on server to generate an HTML interface.</li>
      <li><b>Applet, Remote Data</b>:
        &lt;100k download. GUI code executes locally, making HTTP
        calls to a remote server for Biblical data</li>
      <li><b>Application, Remote Data</b>:
        0k extra download. I think that we ought to be able to use the
        browsers cache to provide a &quot;Save As...&quot; dialog with zero or
        very low download to turn the applet into an application.</li>
      <li><b>Application, Local Data</b>:
        Selectable download. We ought to be able to provide a variety
        of installation sizes, from a heavily cached, disk hungry installation
        down to a Bible version in a few hundred K.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li><b>Low Development Barrier</b>:
    CatB notes how important it is that users can help with
    development. The code is fully JavaDoc commented, and features like the
    DetailedExceptionDialog should help people analyse faults. I plan a
    &quot;How can I help?&quot; wizard to help people request features, and
    offer help.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Listing the important sections from the bottom up:
<ul>
  <li><b>Passage</b>:
    Collection of information about the structure of the Bible.</li>
  <li><b>Book</b>:
    An interface to a real store of Biblical data.</li>
  <li><b>Search</b>:
    Provides a search engine to ease access to the source and passage sections.</li>
  <li><b>View</b>:
    There are several front end packages under development, in order of usefulness:
    servlet, office, swing, applet, wfc</li>
  <li><b>Other</b>:
    There are other support packages, the most significant being config which
    organizes the whole system, there are many others.</li>
</ul>
