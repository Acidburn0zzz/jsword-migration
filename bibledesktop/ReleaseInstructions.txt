Release process:

Step 1: Update the application's release number

On a Major release update the second number, on a minor change the third.
The first gets changed if there is a super major change.
Pretend that 1.0.9 is the next release number (because the current release is 1.0.8).
Change org.crosswire.bibledesktop.desktop.Msg.properties Desktop.Version=1.0.9
In the ant file common/core.xml change to <property name="release.version" value="1.0.9"/>
Update bibledesktop/etc/installer/macosx/info.plist. The release number is repeated many times.
Update bibledesktop/etc/installer/win32/BibleDesktop.nsi PROCUCT_VERSION "1.09"
Update bibledesktop-web/src/web/download.html.

Step 2: Update the release files for the current jar names.
Update bibledesktop/etc/installer/macosx/info.plist
Update bibledesktop/etc/jnlp/bibledesktop.jnlp
Check in the changes for these 2 steps.

Step 3: Perform a clean build

Execute an ant build all in jsword-web. (jsword-web-ant-all in Eclipse)
Clean up all findbugs, pmd and checkstyle issues that make sense to do.
(Currently there are 1 findbugs, 1 pmd and 2 checkstyle issues that can be ignored.)
Fix any javadoc issues.
Check in any files that changed.
Re-execute the ant if any files changed.

Step 4: Build the Windows installer
Right click on bibledesktop/etc/installer/win32/BibleDesktop.nsi and compile the NSIS script.
(You need to be in Windows with NSIS installed)
Verify that the installer works.
You can perform part of step 7 now.

Step 5: Build the MacOS X installer
Get bibledesktop-web/src/web/stable/BibleDesktop-v1.0.8.dmg
Open it to get a copy of the BibleDesktop.app
Get a copy of the previous BibleDesktop.app from the previous dmg.
Replace BibleDesktop.app/Contents/info.plist with bibledesktop/etc/installer/macosx/info.plist
Replace all the jar files in BibleDesktop.app/Contents/Resources/Java with those from bibledesktop/target/installed
Control(Right) Click on the BibleDesktop dmg and Open With Disk Utility.
Convert the dmg to read/write, mount and open it.
Copy the modified BibleDesktop.app into the opened, r/w disk image.
Eject the disk image.
Convert it to a compressed image and take the opportunity to rename it.
Save it into the bibledesktop/etc/installers/macosx directory, temporarily.
Don't check in the disk image.
Verify that the installer works.
You can perform part of step 7 now.
