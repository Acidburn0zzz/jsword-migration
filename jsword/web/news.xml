Sword drivers are now fixed in CVS once more amd we've made lots of GUI bug fixes.
The only work that I know of before we release a beta version is to add Dictionary
and Commentary support to the Sword drivers.

It is known to work on Windows, Linux and OS-X.

some reports of failures on Windows.

Currently working on releasing a beta for JSword v1.0. The remaining 
tasks (other than bug fixes) are some GUI polishing - mostly to sort

the website was on the list, but I guess if you can read this ...
