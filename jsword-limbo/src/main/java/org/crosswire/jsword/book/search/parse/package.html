<p>The search package is responsible for taking a text string "God
&amp; loves &amp; world" and turning it into a series of calls to
<code>Book</code> and <code>Passage</code> to find the answer. I am a
little concerned that this design is a little complex, but I'm sure that
stewing on it will make things come clear.</p>

<h4>The Current Design</h4>

<p>These are the requirements of the search.Engine:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adaptable to new syntaxes </li>
    <li>Extensible to easily add new commands and allow for 
        remote searches </li>
    <li>Simple to extend without any changes to the Engine itself</li>
</ul>

<p>This is how the current design works. The user types a string like
"<i>aaron ~5 &amp; moses &amp; thesarus talk</i>". (This means;
find Moses within 5 verses of Aaron alongside some speach type activity).
The <code>Engine</code> prepends the string "/" and tokenizes
this into a Vector of <code>SearchWords</code> - one
<code>SearchWord</code> for each part of the search string. The Vector
(using Java array syntax) looks like this: { "/",
"aaron", "~", "5", "&amp;",
"moses", "&amp;", "thesaurus",
"talk" }.</p>

<p><code>SearchWord</code> is an interface, implemented in several ways.
The Engine selects which <code>SearchWord</code>to use from a Hashtable
of <code>SearchWord</code>s. The members of this Hashtable are the
available <code>SearchWord</code>s keyed on a token (in this example the
tokens are /, ~, &amp;, &amp; and thesaurus). A
<code>DefaultParamWord</code> is created for the words in the search
string that do not have keys in the Hashtable (aaron, moses and talk)</p>

<p>The Vector is better understood like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>/ aaron </li>
    <li>~ 5 </li>
    <li>&amp; moses </li>
    <li>&amp; thesaurus talk</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these 9 elements in the Vector is a <code>SearchWord</code>.
The first element on each line (/, ~, &amp; and &amp;) is a
<code>CommandWord</code>, the others (aaron, 5, moses, thesaurus and
talk) are ParameterWords. <code>CommandWord</code> and
<code>ParamWord</code> inherit from <code>SearchWord</code>.</p>

<p>So in other word you could write the Vector like this, note the new
bullet points are for each CommandWord, the Vector is strictly 1D an does
not care at all for the difference between CommandWords and
ParamWords:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AddCommandWord(), DefaultParamWord("aaron") </li>
    <li>BlurCommandWord(), DefaultParamWord("5") </li>
    <li>RetainCommandWord(), DefaultParamWord("moses") </li>
    <li>RetainCommandWord(), ThesaurusParamWord(),
        DefaultParamWord("talk")</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that all the <code>DefaultParamWord</code>s are
created from unknown tokens. The other <code>SearchWord</code>s (both
<code>CommandWord</code>s (/, ~ and &amp;) and the <code>ParamWord</code>
(thesaurus)) were members of the Hashtable in the Engine.</p>

<p>The search Engine loops, taking an element from the Vector - expecting
it to be a <code>CommandWord</code> and calling
<code>CommandWord.updatePassage()</code>. These <code>CommandWord</code>s
have the opportunity to take elements from the Vector and treat them as
<code>ParamWord</code>s. Any error is a ClassCastException which is
caught and translated into a sensible error message.</p>

<h4>Historical Designs</h4>

<p>This does NOT represent the current design. I've left it here to show
the steps I went through to get to the current design. There were 2
possible designs. The smart engine model and the smart data model. The
latter won. The ideas were like this:</p>

<h4>Smart Engine Model</h4>

<P>The engine understands how to parse the search string 
into a series of calls to the relevant places. The engine is extensible by 
adding new 'commands' (Which must follow an <code>SearchWord</code>s
interface - now deleted). This model has the advantage of simplicity, and
memory-efficiency.</P>

<h4>Smart Data Model</h4>

<p>The engine simply turns the search string into a data structure, the
nodes of this document are instansiated as classes that follow an
interface with a <code>getAnswer()</code> interface. Calling
<code>getAnswer()</code> on the root node recurses down to find the
answer. The big advantage of this model is that it can be readily
extended to several types of interface - from the most basic GUI find 
dialog to a ridiculously powerful command line version.</p>

<p>I toyed with an XML based engine. The Engine parses the search string
into an XML Document. Something like this:</p>

<p>XML representation of the above search, and the code that implements
it</p>
 
<pre>&lt;search&gt;                        // ref = new Passage();
  &lt;add&gt;                         // ref.addAll(
    &lt;word&gt;aaron&lt;/word&gt;          //   default_bible.getPassages("aaron")
  &lt;/add&gt;                        // );
  &lt;blur&gt;5&lt;/blur&gt;                // ref.blur(5);
  &lt;retain&gt;                      // ref.retainAll(
    &lt;word&gt;moses&lt;/word&gt;          //   default_bible.getPassages("moses")
  &lt;/retain&gt;                     // );
  &lt;add&gt;                         // ref.addAll(
    &lt;words&gt;                     //   default_bible.getPassages(
      &lt;thesarus&gt;talk&lt;/thesarus&gt; //     thesarus.getSynonyms("talk")
    &lt;/words&gt;                    //   )
  &lt;/add&gt;                        // );
&lt;/search&gt;                       // return ref;
</pre>

<p>The benefit of this is that it allows us to easily remote the whole
search engine. I seem to have an XML disease, so why shouldn't it affect
here!</p>

<P>However I decided that a remote search engine was of little benefit
since the individual <code>SearchWord</code>s can be remoted via a very
simple stub - giving an engine that can be remoted piecemeal. The only
drawback to this solution is on high latency networks (erm like the
Internet) where a set of simple requests can take a lot longer than a
single complex one. However I am sure that I could XMLize or serialize
the Vector invented above.</p>

<h4>SoundEx</h4>
