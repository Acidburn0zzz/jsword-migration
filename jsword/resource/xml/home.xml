<line title='Introduction'>

Project B is a platform for various Bible programs using Java.
It will support desktop applications like the On-Line Bible and Sword,
there is a <a href='spage'>Servlet interface</a>, some add-in
macros for MS Word. Other interfaces are in development.
<br/>
It is freely redistributable (licensed under the GPL). The source is
available in the <link src='source'>source</link> section, along with
documentation, and you can download the program from the
<link src='download'>download</link> section.

<line title='Current Release'>

The most recent release is version v0.7. It incorporates many of the
features of the OnLine Bible, although it is still beta software. If it
breaks, please <link src='contact'>tell me</link> about it Not all of
the features are available through this interface.

<line title='About This Site'>

The site is supposed to be very flexible in the way it generates pages.
You can configure the look using the <a href='sconfig1'>configuration</a>
pages.
<br/>
It is all done using Java, Servlets, Smoke and Mirrors. Most of the pages
are dynamically generated from very thin XML pages that contain a bare
minimum set of markup. They are then parsed and a full web page is
generated using XSL. Sound complex? It is fairly hard to get going, but
it means that the data and the layout are separate. I can change either
without thinking about the other. I could blanket change the site to have
a blue background by changing a single file, and I only need a very few
tags to do all the layout.
<br/>
One of the aims is to have an applet version of this site that takes off
where servlets are not powerful enough. There is a very quick demo
<link src='resolve'>here</link>, although dont expect anything dramatic.
