<h1>J-Sword</h1>
<p>
  The J-Sword Project is a group of programs that work together to bring Bible
  study to a wide range of people using the Java platform. It includes Bible
  Desktop, a desktop based Bible study tool.
</p>

<p>
  Since it is written in Java (JDK 1.4) it will run on most computers.
  Currently we regularly test on Windows, Linux and MacOS X, but it ought to
  work on Solaris and other places where JDK 1.4 is available, and could be
  easily extended to work on set-top boxes and PDAs.
</p>

<p>
  The software produced by the J-Sword project is open source software so it is
  freely available to anyone.
  It is licensed under the <a href="api\docs\Licence.html">GPL</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There are several components to the J-Sword project, the most commonly used is
  Bible Desktop. There is also a simple web interface that is part of the
  JSword-Web sub-project. The core API is called J-Sword and there is a generic
  library of useful utilities called common.
</p>

      We intend to provide a solution for using XML from Java that is as simple as Java itself.
      There is no compelling reason for a Java API to manipulate XML to be complex, tricky, unintuitive, or a pain in the neck. JDOM is both Java-centric and Java-optimized. It behaves like Java, it uses Java collections, it is completely natural API for current Java developers, and it provides a low-cost entry point for using XML.
