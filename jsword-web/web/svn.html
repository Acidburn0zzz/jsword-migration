  <title>JSword - Getting Involved</title>

<h1>Source Code Access</h1>
<h2>This is currently under construction. Some info is inaccurate.</h2>
<p>
  Our source code is managed with Subversion, aka SVN. SVN is hosted at crosswire. The SVN root is:<br />
  <code>https://crosswire.org/svn/jsword</code><br />
  And the password is "anonymous". If you need to get at the code but are not
  sure about SVN then join the mailing list and we'll sort something out. The
  module to checkout is 'jsword', so if you are using the command line you would
  do something like this<br />
  <code>svn checkout https://crosswire.org/svn/jsword/trunk/jsword jsword</code>.<br />
  There is also a support module containing 3rd-party source jars, tools to
  build the website, UML models and a default KJV module. To get access to this
  you will need to check-out <code>jsword-support</code>.
